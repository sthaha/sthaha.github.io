### Show files in a commit ###

E.g show all files in the commit pointed by HEAD

{% highlight bash %}
  git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD
{% endhighlight %}


This is quite handy when you want to open all files modified by a commit in
your editor

{% highlight bash %}
    vim $( git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD )
{% endhighlight %}
